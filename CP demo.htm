<title> How it works</title>
	<h1>Add your skills</h1>
	<h2>Add your skills using your current job or add skills individually</h2>
	<p>Even when you save your skills to an account, no-one can see them unless you choose to make them discoverable (more about that later)</p>

	<h1>See role matches</h1>
	<h2>See what roles match your skills</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h1>See relevant jobs</h1>
	<h2>See what's expected in these roles and see available jobs for these roles</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h1>See what's hot</h1>
	<h2>See which roles are most needed and which roles pay the most</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Get discovered</h1>
	<h2>Make your skills discoverable for new opportunities</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Start a plan and pick role goals</h1>
	<h2>Work out where you want to go</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Get there faster</h1>
	<h2>Find the most efficient training to reach you goalso</h2>
	<p>Tip:If you are already a public servant and you start a plan with your work email address, you'll get access to more resources</p>
